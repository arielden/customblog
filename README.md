## Setup
- I made a custom miniconda env for this project "django_env".

Create the env and install django:

conda create -n django_env python=3.11
conda activate django_env
pip install django
``` 
- check django version with:
```
python -m django --version
```
- start the project generating the folder structure (on the desired path)
```
django-admin startproject customblog
```
